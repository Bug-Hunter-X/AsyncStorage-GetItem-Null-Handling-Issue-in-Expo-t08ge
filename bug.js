This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo, specifically when trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist.  It's not a typical `TypeError: null is not an object` because it doesn't immediately point to a null value. Instead, the issue is subtle: the asynchronous nature of `AsyncStorage.getItem` means the value might not be ready when you try to use it. If the key doesn't exist, getItem resolves with null, but operations performed before the null value is properly handled will cause unexpected behavior.  This can lead to crashes or silent failures, depending on the context.
